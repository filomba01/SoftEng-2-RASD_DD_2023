\section{Purpose}
\label{s:Purpose}%

The CodeKata is a learning method that takes inspiration from the Kata techniques and is based on continuous practice which became very popular in those years.

CodeKataBattle delineates an innovative platform geared towards enhancing students' software development skills through collaborative learning using CodeKataâ€™s fundamentals. Facilitated by educators, CKB provides a dynamic environment where students engage in code kata battles, refining their programming proficiency and embracing best practices such as the test-driven development approach.

Similar to recent initiatives addressing global challenges, CKB empowers educators to orchestrate challenges within tournaments, fostering healthy competition and cultivating an environment for skill enhancement. The platform enables educators to define battle parameters, set deadlines, and configure scoring criteria, fostering a tailored and effective learning experience.

At its core, a code kata battle presents students with programming challenges within specific language frameworks, coupled with exhaustive test cases. Teams collaboratively tackle these exercises, adhering to a test-first methodology and submitting solutions to the platform upon battle completion.

CKB's automated evaluation system ensures an impartial assessment of student submissions. Automated scrutiny covers mandatory factors, including functional aspects, timeliness, and source code quality, offering an unbiased representation of team performance. Educators can further enhance evaluations with optional manual assessments, providing nuanced insights into student work.
