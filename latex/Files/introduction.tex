\section{Purpose}
\label{s:Purpose}%

The CodeKata is a learning method that takes inspiration from the Kata techniques and is based on continuous practice which became very popular in those years.

CodeKataBattle delineates an innovative platform geared towards enhancing students' software development skills through collaborative learning using CodeKataâ€™s fundamentals. Facilitated by educators, CKB provides a dynamic environment where students engage in code kata battles, refining their programming proficiency and embracing best practices such as the test-driven development approach.

Similar to recent initiatives addressing global challenges, CKB empowers educators to orchestrate challenges within competition, fostering healthy competition and cultivating an environment for skill enhancement. The platform enables educators to define battle parameters, set deadlines, and configure scoring criteria, fostering a tailored and effective learning experience.

At its core, a code kata battle presents students with programming challenges within specific language frameworks, coupled with exhaustive test cases. Teams collaboratively tackle these exercises, adhering to a test-first methodology and submitting solutions to the platform upon battle completion.

CKB's automated evaluation system ensures an impartial assessment of student submissions. Automated scrutiny covers mandatory factors, including functional aspects, timeliness, and source code quality, offering an unbiased representation of team performance. Educators can further enhance evaluations with optional manual assessments, providing nuanced insights into student work.

\subsection{Goals}
\label{ss:goals}%
The CKB platform aims to provide a collaborative environment for students to practice and refine their software development skills. The platform enables educators to orchestrate challenges within competitions, fostering healthy competition and cultivating an environment for skill enhancement. The platform enables educators to define battle parameters, set deadlines, and configure scoring criteria, fostering a tailored and effective learning experience.

The platform will be used by two types of users: Educators (ED) and Students (ST). The ED will be able to create competitions and battles within competitions. The ST will be able to create teams and join battles as a team or individually. The platform will provide a dashboard for code submission and automated evaluation of the code submitted. The platform will also provide a ranking of the competition and battles.

Below there is the table of goals that the platform will achieve:
\begin{longtable}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{\#} & \textbf{Goal}      \\
  \hline
  G1 & Enable ED to manage Competitions \\
  \hline
  G2 & Enable ED to manage Code Battles within Competitions \\
  \hline
  G3 & Enable ST to participate in a Competition \\
  \hline
  G4 & Enable ST to be part of a team within a battle \\
  \hline
  G5 & Send Notifications to STs   \\
  \hline
  G6 & Automatically Create GitHub Repositories for Every Battle in a Competition    \\
  \hline
  G7 & Synchronize the Submission of Each Candidate with Their GitHub Repository   \\
  \hline
  G8 & CKB Provides an evaluation of the code submitted    \\
  \hline
  G9 & Allow users to View Rankings in both battles and competitions   \\
  \hline
  G10 & Allow to assign badges to the students    \\
