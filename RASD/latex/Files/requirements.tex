\label{s:External_interface_requirements}%

\subsection{User Interfaces}
\label{ss:User_interfaces}%

The CKB user interface will be a web page that will be accessed through a web browser. The web page will be designed to be simple and easy to use with the support for multiple screen sizes and devices.

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\label{ss:Hardware_interfaces}%

The platform requires a computer with a web browser and an internet connection to access the CKB web page. 

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\label{ss:Software_interfaces}%

CKB will be using some software interfaces both from external systems and internal implemented ones in order to provide the services. The interfaces used are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Github API:} CKB will use Github as source control system for the projects. The Github API will be used to create the repositories for each team in the battle and share it with the team members.
  \item \textbf{Static Analyzer:} CKB will use a static analysis tool to analyze the code of each team after every new commit and will use the result of the analysis to assign points to each team. The purpose of this interface is to give the possibility to the system to configure the analyzer as the educator needs, in terms of test cases, languages supported and other parameters.
  \item \textbf{Results API: } The \textit{SA\_Server} will use this API to send the results of the analysis to the main server.
  \item \textbf{Github Actions: } Github Actions will notify the system when a participant has pushed a new commit to its repository. The \textit{SA\_Server} will be listening to this notifications and will trigger the analysis of the source code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
\label{ss:Communication_interfaces}%

All the communication between CKB, the external interfaces and the user will be done using HTTPS protocol.

\subsubsection*{Use case diagram}
Here you can find the use case diagram of the platform.

For simplicity we decided not to include all the \textit{<<include>>} relationship related to the \textbf{\textit{Login}} use case, since  almost every use case requires the user to be logged in, this was to explain that it was not forgotten.

\section{Performance Requirements}
\label{s:Performance_requirements}%

\subsection*{Concurrent connections}
\label{ss:Concurrent_connections}%

Since the connections during the phases of the competitions will for sure be very high we need to ensure that the system can handle a big number of concurrent connections. Considering an average number of partecipant in a competition of 300 and an average number of battles per competition of 5, we can estimate that the number of concurrent connections will be around 2000. To ensure that multiple competition can be run at the same time we need to ensure that the system can handle at least 10000 concurrent connections.

\subsection*{Response time}
\label{ss:Response_time}%

The system should be able to respond to a request in less than 1 second. In particular the system should be able to respond to a request in less than 0.5 seconds for the most common requests (i.e. login, signup, create competition, create battle, join battle, join team, evaluate code, visualize ranking).

\subsection*{Scalability}
\label{ss:Scalability}%

The system should be able to scale to support more competitions and battles. In particular the system should be able to support at least 1000 competitions and 10000 battles.



\section{Design Constraints}
\label{s:Design_constraints}%

\subsection{Standard compliance}
\label{ss:Standard_compliance}%

The system should respect the laws about privacy and data protection of the country in which it is used. In particular for the use in Europe it should respect the GDPR. Morover the system should respect the data treatment for exchange with third party systems (i.e. GitHub).

\subsection{Hardware limitation}
\label{ss:Hardware_limitation}%

The system should be able to run on any device with a browser and an internet connection. The system should be able to run on any operating system.

\subsection{Any other constraint}
\label{ss:Any_other_constraint}%

There are no other constraints.

\section{Software System Attributes}
\label{s:Software_system_attributes}%

\subsection{Reliability}
\label{ss:Reliability}%

Since the system is not critical as the code from the student is uploaded on Github, it is not necessary to have a high reliability. It is reasonable to have a failure rate between 0.1\% and 1\% to ensure an high quality service. In any case the system should be able to recover the data and state in case of failure.

\subsection{Availability}
\label{ss:Availability}%

To ensure a good user experience and permit the ED to make changes to the competition and battles, the system should guarantee an availability of 99\%.


\subsection{Security}
\label{ss:Security}%

The system guarantees the security of the communication between the users and the server using the HTTPS protocol. The system should guarantee the security of the data stored in the database using encryption and access control. 

\subsection{Maintainability}
\label{ss:Maintainability}%

The system should be easy to maintain and update. The code should be well documented and the architecture should be well designed to allow the addition of new features and the correction of bugs.

\subsection{Portability}
\label{ss:Portability}%

The system does not have restriction on the operating system and the browser. The system should be developed as a web application with a responsive design to allow the use on different devices.
