In this section we will describe the user interface design of the system. We will provide a mockup of the main pages of the system and a description of the main functionalities of the system.

The user interface of the system is designed to be simple and intuitive. As the system is intended to be used with a desktop browser, the interfaces presented here are based on a desktop browser, but the interface is thought to be responsive and consequently usable also on mobile devices.\\
